\section{Budget evaluation}
\label{sec:budget}
Identification and evaluation of all the costs of the project is necessary to do a more accurate approximation of the total budget needed to build it. There are different types of resources that have associated costs and also we need to make clear all possible unexpected costs and how they modify the final budget.

This project estimated development time is 462 hours as concluded in the section \ref{ssec:tasksAndResources}, so this economical analysis will be performed using this information.

In addition, a small percent will be added to the final budget in order to cope with possible and unforeseen deviations (contingency plan). This percent is a 10\% of the total budget.
