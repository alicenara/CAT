\subsubsection{Unforeseen costs}
As stated in the scheduling part, section \ref{sec:sched}, tasks may take a little longer than expected due to the need of lots of hours of testing. In that case, the final budget may increase but not significantly: software testing costs 10€/h (60€/day) and software developing costs 15€/h (90€/day), so even if more hours of testing are needed or some code modifications must be done, the final cost will increase between 60 and 90 euros per extra day.

We assume the possibility that a delay happen is of 35\%, and with that data we can calculate how much this would costs:

Expense per day of delay: 0,35 of possibility * 90 euros per day * 3 days left = 94,50 €

Another unforeseen cost is the one we will have if there are no testers from a censored country, as we need to prove and get results of the performance of the final software on a real situation. If this happens, we will need to pay a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service, what will cost around 10€ per month.
