\subsection{Economic sustainability}
All costs (human and material resources) are set and explained in this document, and also there are some sections about unexpected costs and budged needed for each extra day out of the scheduling.

Additional costs for maintenance and updates after the project finishes are difficult to predict since it is an Open Source project, so anyone will be able to contribute. Plus future contributors will be volunteers, so they will not expect to be paid.

About doing all this project with less budget and in less time, it seems a very difficult task to accomplish because a big part of the budget is expended in people actually building the application. Also, almost all material resources are free; only some budget can be saved if we do not use non-free operative systems like Windows but then we will lose 90\% of the initial targets. We can discard OSX but it only represents a 3\% of the final budget. 

The timetable delivered in the last document shows that we will spend almost the same amount of hours coding than testing the project, due to testing is an extremely important part of it. So we split this project total time according to the importance of the task. 

Finally, this project economical viability grade is a 9 as there are only a few things that can be changed to get a lower price, but overall it is affordable.
