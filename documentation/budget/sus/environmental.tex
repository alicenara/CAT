\subsection{Environmental sustainability}
All resources used in the project have been precised in the \textit{Budget estimation} section of this document, and in the \textit{Scheduling} section of the last one.

The only resources we will need in this project are the computer and the paper we will use to print the final documentation, so it will not really be an impact in the environment.

An estimation of the energy that we will spend developing the project is 1,8kWh * 516 h = 928.8kW. Assuming that each kW generates 0.166 kg of C0$_2$, 928.8 kW is equivalent to 154.18 kg of CO$_2$. It is a high amount but also is produced throughout all the project development.

For all the reasons stated above, this project environmental sustainability value will be a 6 because even if we cannot consume less with actual resources, it produces a high amount of C0$_2$ that can increase as the project may be tested in volunteers computers, so it can possibly produce more CO$_2$ than what is considered here.
