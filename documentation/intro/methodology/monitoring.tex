\subsection{Monitoring tools}

To develop this project we will need some control version of the code, the design and the documentation, as this is the best way to undo only recent changes if we found an error some days after doing it, or to retrieve the project if the computer gets broken. 

Moreover as this project will be an Open Source one, it is better to use an open platform in order to allow everyone to contribute in testing phases so to find bugs and improve the user interface. 

\pagebreak
For this reasons, we will use Github as a repository platform to upload all the files of this project and also git to do the control versions. The repository of this project can be found in \cite{ThisProjectGit}.

All other tools we will use to build this project are explained on section \ref{ssec:resources} of this document.
