\subsection{Validation process}
In this case, a proper and exhaustive validation process is mandatory considering it could be a threat to whoever running it if it has security leaks. The testing must be done using tools like Wireshark (network sniffer), to be totally sure of what is the software sending, when (sleeping periods), to whom and how responses are.

To do all validations there will be a lot of testing phases in the main development task, as we will build a prototype to be tested after adding some new features. And this prototypes will be tested not only by us but also by volunteers like the Tor community even if we will accept other volunteers that want to contribute.

There will be meetings with the TFG director as well and a lot of communication through email, what will help to detect errors and deviations both on planning and budget fast in order to be able to correct them as soon as possible.
