\subsection{Objectives}
The main objective of this project is to build a solution that helps to understand how censors block the access to the Tor network. However, there are some other goals we expect to achieve: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The final software needs to be lightweight in order to allow the user run this software without overloading the machine, as it is not a project that needs a lot of resources.
\item Its total size must be reduced so it can be downloaded fast.
\item Another important goal is to build a really easy to use interface to increment usability, so it can be adopted by any type of user (experienced with computers or not).
\item This project needs to be secure and noiseless (we need to prevent from being detected) as it may cause problems to the people running it if some measures are not taken into account.
\end{itemize}
