\subsection{Obstacles and contingency plans}
\label{ssec:obstacles}
One of the most difficult parts of this project is to test it in a really censored country like China, Syria or Iran. 

Even though it will be tested a lot in a free country (Spain), as its Internet is not censored (or at least, not much) it will not provide a high reliability about being really useful, untraceable and noiseless. So in order to do some proper testing, we will ask for help to the Tor community and also find other ways of getting a machine inside a censored country (like with a VPN).  

Also another problem will be that not all Linux binaries work in all Unix distributions, but its solution dwell in compiling this software multiple times for different systems when the need grows.
