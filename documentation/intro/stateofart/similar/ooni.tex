\subsubsection{Ooni Probe}
Ooni Probe \cite{OoniProbe} is the most akin to this project and is a scanner too. It is written in Python and checks local connections searching for blocked or modified content. It is done by running several tests that users needs to start manually (it is not as user friendly as this project will be \cite{GitOoni}). It also does not protect user's identity neither when performing tests (its priority is not to hide user's information) nor when executing on a machine (it leaves traces that can be seen with forensics analysis).
