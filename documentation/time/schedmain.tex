\section{Scheduling}
\label{sec:sched}
In order to accomplish all points we have explained in section \ref{ssec:scope} (Scope of the project), we must divide this project in the necessary steps and give them the necessary amount of time to be fully completed, including some extra time for the obstacles we can come across, described in section \ref{ssec:obstacles}. 

So this section is about temporal planning: what are this project main tasks and how critical they are, what resources will be needed in order to do each task and, finally, how resources and tasks are related. All this scheduling is graphically shown as a Gantt chart in section \ref{ssec:gantt}, so we can get an overview of this project different stages.

This TFG was started on January 20, 2016 and its deadline is on June 28, 2016. This planning, however, could be further modified as all testing phases will partially depend on other people so it may suffer few delays.
