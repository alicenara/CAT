\subsection{Task description}
\label{ssec:tasks}
All this project tasks are described below, some divided in several parts as they are complex. 

For each task first there is a summary of the hours assigned, the hours of work per day and the equivalent weeks of work and then an explanation of each task goals and subtasks to do. We will assume that each week only has five working days. 

In addition to all the following tasks, there will be at least three control meetings with the director of the project (one after the design task in section \ref{sssec:design}, one after the third sprint in section \ref{sssec:mainDev} and the final will be before starting the last task in section \ref{sssec:finalTask}) which duration will be of 3 hours per meeting. 

And the last task in Gantt chart, named "Final presentation", will be bureaucratic time regarding the lecture of the TFG, as we need to send it finished one week before the final presentation.
