\par{\textbf{Explanation}}\\
Usability on user interface is a really important part on this project since we want it to adapt to all kind of users: from beginners to experts. To accomplish this goal, our interface will need to be easy to use, simple (so everything can be found easily), and it would be nice if even we can avoid to put a lot of text in English, so it will not need to be translated in order to be used from people around the world. 

In order to meet usability requirements, a proper design is needed to be done before starting to code, as it is important to organize where each feature will be and how they will be accessed. 

As this task will be done using a cascade methodology, after designing the initial mockup, some usability tests will be done to improve the user interface.

Moreover, the software final design may change as there will be some testing phases in the development task \ref{sssec:mainDev}, where we will receive improvements proposals from volunteers, so although this task will define the bases, it may not be the final one.

It will take a week and it will be started along with the first sprint of the Main development task, considering this iteration (\ref{sssec:mainDev} Sprint 1 - Script research and analysis) may add some tests to the final project, causing the design to be changed.
