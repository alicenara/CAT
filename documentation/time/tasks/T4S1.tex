\textbf{Explanation}\\
The main goal of this sprint is to find useful and already finished scripts to build all program main features: test censorship against Tor website, directory authorities, relays and bridges; analyse traffic and do some reports.

Still, some modifications will be necessary to adapt this scripts to this project, even redo some of them, and this is something that must be evaluated in this sprint too.

In addition, few more tests may be added to improve censorship analysis on each one of this project main features.

It is a very important task and will last for a week, along with the design task.
