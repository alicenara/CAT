\textbf{Explanation}\\
The purpose of this sprint is to gather information about ways of hiding (from the ISP) a network analysis, options to prevent leaving traces on the machine that is running the program, and some operative systems (OS) specific research (as a subsequent task is to compile the program for Windows OS, Mac OS and Linux OS).

It is a critical task, as it is really necessary to avoid problems in censored countries, so this research is crucial to the rest of the project. The next sprint cannot start if this one is not finished or almost finished.

Also in this task there will be some few hours (near 3) focused on adding to the documentation an analysis of all information found.
