\textbf{Explanation}

This sprint main goal is to build a first prototype of the project that will be able to analyse traffic and collect possible censure information. It will also need to keep user's anonymity as much as possible.

This first prototype will be a base software to start adding all other main features, so it is important to be done properly before starting the next sprint.
