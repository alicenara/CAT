\textbf{Explanation}

Finally, the prototype will be able to obtain some debug information in order to have deeper analysis, and then send all recollected data to Tor project (via secret and secure communication) to provide them the needed clues to bypass the censorship.

Duration: a week to develop (it will also start before finishing the 4th sprint testing week) and another of testing with Tor volunteers.

This is also a very important part of the project (this software main purpose in fact).
