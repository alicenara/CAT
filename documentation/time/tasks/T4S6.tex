\textbf{Explanation}

In this last sprint, the final product will be compiled for the most used Operative System distributions and some executables will be released.

Duration: four days to develop (starting in the middle of the 5 th sprint testing phase) and a week of testing.

Although this task is not as important as previous ones, it will allow the application to reach more users, so global analysis reports will be more accurate.
