\textbf{Explanation}

Once finished all other tasks, we will need at least 35 more hours to prepare everything for the final presentation of this project.

This final task will have two important parts:
\begin{description}
\item Final testing 

Some tests will be done in order to ensure that the project is working correctly and we will do as well some tests in a partially (at least) country in order to get real data. And this will take at least 10 more hours of work.

\item Documentation

Since a final document must be done before finishing the project, and we spent 10 hours writing documentation in the main development task, we must spend at least 25 more hours to finish writing and checking.

We also assume that almost all documentation obtained on the second task, the Planning Management, will be used for this task, so that is why do the documentation do not need more than 35 hours in total.
\end{description}

Also we will need to send this document a week before the final presentation and we will use 5 more hours to prepare the presentation.
